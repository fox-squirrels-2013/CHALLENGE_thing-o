## Learning Objectives

1. Get at grasp on all of the Phase 2 :+1: learning objectives through a concrete example. 

## Summary

Welcome to the thing-o playground.  The purpose of this challenge is to give you a place to test out all the new technologies you will be learning. You will be working on this solo, with pairs, and in 'delete and switch' situations so be ready to detach from your code and attach to your learning. 

## Releases
### Release 1
* Choose your thing-o (something you love like bicycles!)
* Create a repo on the github organization for our cohort titled "Thing-O:Your Name".  All code for this challenge will live there. 
* Add a readme with notes on your steps in each release.
* Push a sinatra app to heroku that allows the user to visit your index page and see a few paragraphs about your thing-o.


## Release 2
* [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) it up using [Restful Routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) - see the first table, [Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and a [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) database. 
* Use nested params.
* Test your models in IRB.  
* Review your data in psql.


## Release 3
* Refactor to MVC file separation.

## Release 4 ... 
CHECK BACK SOON!
