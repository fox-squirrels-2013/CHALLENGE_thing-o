## Learning Objectives

1. Get at grasp on all of the Phase 2 :+1: learning objectives through a concrete example. 

## Summary

Welcome to the thing-o playground.  The purpose of this challenge is to give you a place to test out all the new technologies you will be learning. You will be working on this solo, with pairs, and in 'delete and switch' situations so be ready to detach from your code and attach to your learning.  Each exercise will be built upon your individualized "THING-O".  A thing-o should be something you are interested in that can be modeled in code. In addition, your thing-o should allow for expansion to something that can be modeled with a many-to-many relationship.   

## Releases
Work through each release completely before moving on.  When you finish a release, make sure you UNDERSTAND the code. Could you give a 5 minute lightning talk on it? Could you reproduce it from scratch? 

### Release 1
* Choose your thing-o (something you love like bicycles!)
* Create a repo on the github organization for our cohort titled "Thing-O:Your Name".  All code for this challenge will live there. 
* Add a readme with notes on your steps in each release.  Update this with what you did / learned in each release.   
* Push a sinatra app to heroku that allows the user to visit your index page and see a few paragraphs about your thing-o.  


## Release 2
* [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) it up using [Restful Routes](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) - see the first table, [Active Record](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and a [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) database.  Create your CRUD in 4 steps.  
  * Step 1: A user can Create an instance of your thing-o and save it to the database.  
    * Test your models in IRB.  
    * Review your data in psql.
  * Step 2: A user can see all the instances of your thing-o.
  * Step 3: A user can update a particular thing-o
  * Step 4: A user can delete a thing-o.


## Release 3
* Refactor to MVC file separation.

## Release 4 ... 
CHECK BACK SOON!
